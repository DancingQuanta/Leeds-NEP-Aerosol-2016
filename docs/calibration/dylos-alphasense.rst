Calibration of Dylos by Alphasense OPCN2
========================================

Dylos Raspberry Pi
------------------

Time is offset by about 23 minutes which was due to accidentally pulling power out while preparing experiment.

Timeline
--------

31/08/16
~~~~~~~~

14:00 Attached nebuliser with deionised water to wash out particles of the pump.
14:50 Introduced 2 um particles
15:40 Took out nebuliser and washed it then filled with deionised water to wash out pump
16:25 Introduced 1 um particles
18:00 Turned off

01/09/16
~~~~~~~~

09:00 Turned on pump, the time on Dylos Pi is 8:35:00

02/09/16
~~~~~~~~
 
13:00 Introduced 2um particles
13:30 Pure water
14:30 Introduced 1um particles
15:00 Pure water

06/09/16
~~~~~~~~

14:00 Introduced 0.8um particles
15:20 Introduced 0.4um particles

07/09/16
~~~~~~~~

10:00 Introduced 0.3um particles
13:10 Introduced 0.2um particles
14:00 Checking the output, I see zero counts, weird.
      I took out nebuliser and added some water, noticing full foam and in the meantime, the counts shot up when I was adding water.
16:20 Introduced 2um particles

08/09/16
~~~~~~~~
 
Pi time is 8:59 to current time 10:22 - 1 hour and 23 mins

09:00 Added more water and 2um particles
10:10 Found water dried up, when the initial level is close to the edge of cone.
10:45 Stopped and restarted sensors
      I unplugged and replugged the sensors, including Dylos without thinking which is a bad idea anyway as it will change the device name.

13;00 Introduced 0.2um particles
15:00 Introduced 1 um particles
16:50 Introduced 0.3um particles
17:35 Stopped pump

09/09/16
~~~~~~~~

Pi time is 6:57 to current time 8:20 - 1 hour and 23 mins

08:15 Started pump with pure water
09:00 Introduced 2um particles
10:30 Introduced 0.4um particles
14:00 Introduced 0.8um particles

15/09/16
--------

09:40 Started pumped with pure water Pi time 8:17
10:40 Introduced 0.8um
12:40 Introduced 0.4um
13:40 Pure water
14:40 Introduced 0.8um

Lost the data...

16/09/16
--------
 
Pi 17:06 to correct time 18:30

14:30 Started Pump
14:40 Introduced 0.8um particles
15:45 Introduced 0.4um particles
17:05 Introduced 0.3um particles
