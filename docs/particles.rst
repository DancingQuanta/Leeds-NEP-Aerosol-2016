I was using particles sizes in the range of 0.2 um to 2 um.
I felt this range is too narrow because the Dylos sensor measures two size ranges, 1-2.5 and 2.5-10.
With more broader size range, I would be able to measure Dylos sensor response to larger particles and observe how the smaller particle detection will vary.

Beware that large particles may have some contamination due to their processing.
This cause an extra signal at lower size than stated, especially significant if large quantities of the solution is used.

May be able to liberate more of the aerosol from their solution by ensuring that the solution's height in the nebulizer is at the top of the cone.
This will evaporate the solution more easily.
