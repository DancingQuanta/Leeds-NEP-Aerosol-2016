Dylos DC1100 Pro and Dylos DC1700
=================================

Both Dylos DC1100 Pro and Dylos DC1700 are cheap air quality monitors with minor differences.
They are priced at \SI{425.00}{\$} and \SI{289.99}{\$} respectively.
The monitors measures the number of particles in two size ranges; $>\SI{0.5}{\um}$ and $>\SI{2.5}{\um}$.
The small particles are detected down to 0.5 um.
The large particles are detected down to 2.5 um.
They output average number of particles per 0.01 cubic foot every minute for each size bin.
To get the number of particles between 0.5 and 2.5 um, subtract the value for large particles from small particles.
The measured concentration is displayed on a screen or through a serial output to which a computer can log data to a file.

There is a study that said the above size range are misleading, the 0.5 um bin represent 2.5 um particles and 2.5 um bin represent 10 um particles. (link)[https://aqicn.org/experiments/what-is-the-dylos-monitor-actually-measuring/]

Upper limit on particle counts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A study by Semple et al. (2012), which involves SHS chamber experiments, has shown that the upper limits of the particle counts per 0.01 cubic foot is 65.356 particles.
This upper limit is set by the memory of the Dylos' microcontroller so when the number of particles increased pass this number, the value rolls over to zero.
In this study, the upper limit is reached when SHS PM 2.5 concentration is about 1000 ug/m3.

Differences between Dylos DC1100 Pro and Dylos DC1700
-----------------------------------------------------

Dylos DC1100 Pro
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

DC1100 have a bit higher sample rate (59 seconds) than DC1700 (60 seconds)


Dylos DC1700
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Dylos DC1700 is a cheap customer-grade air quality monitor, priced at \SI{425.00}{\$} and measures the number of particles in two size ranges; $>\SI{0.5}{\um}$ and $>\SI{2.5}{\um}$.
The monitor output an average number of particles per 0.01 cubic foot every minute for each size range.
The measured concentration is displayed on a screen or through a serial output to which a computer can log data to a file.
The Dylos is battery powered which last for 6 hours and have a memory storage which store data for approximately whole week.

Maintenance
-----------

For long term measurement, Dylos needs extensive cleaning of its internal due to dust collecting inside which will interfer with its readings. ^[https://aqicn.org/faq/2013-10-21/dylos-air-particule-conter-experiment-maintenance/]
This is a common problem with research grade experiments so Dylos needs to be treated as such.

If a Dylos is placed in an area in which its measures high particles count then this Dylos needs to be maintained more than others to ensure that it produces realistic readings.

Dylos in literature
-------------------

The Dylos has been used and evaluated in other studies, both indoors and outdoors, e.g. by Semple et al. (2012, 2013), in the context of exposure to SHS, and by Northcross et al. (2013) and Holstius et al. (2014) who compared the performance of the Dylos against other commercially-available particle monitors (both for chamber and ambient environments).
