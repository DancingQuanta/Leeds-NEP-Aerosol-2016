Sensors
=======

The sensors used in this project are optical particle counters.
An optical particle counter counts a number of particles in air by scattering light off the particles.
In an optical particle counter, a steady flow of air crosses a laser beam.
The particles in the flow will cross the laser beam and scatter light off it.
A photodetector, placed perpendicular to both air flow and laser beam, measures the amount and duration of light scattering by each particle.

The optical particle counters in this investigation is shown below:
