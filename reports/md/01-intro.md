# Introduction

This report describes an investigation into calibration of Dylos DC1700 Air Quality Monitor against Grimm Portable Aerosol Spectrometer 1.108 and Alphasense OPC-N2.
The instruments are optical particle counters.

An OPC counts a number of particles in air by measuring the light scattered off particles.
In an OPC, a steady flow of air crosses a laser beam.
The particles in the air flow scatter light as they cross the laser beam and a photodetector measures the intensity and duration of scattered light.
From the optical measurements, a number of particles could be counted into different size bins.

The calibration were performed within a plastic box where calibration particles of difference sizes were introduced into the box and the resulting particle distribution were measured by the instruments inside the box.
