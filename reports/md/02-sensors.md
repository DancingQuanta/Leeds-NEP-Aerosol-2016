# Aerosol measuring instruments

Dylos DC1700 is a cheap customer-grade air quality monitor, priced at \SI{425.00}{\$} and measures the number of particles in two size ranges; $>\SI{0.5}{\um}$ and $>\SI{2.5}{\um}$.
The monitor output an average number of particles per 0.01 cubic foot every minute for each size range.
The measured concentration is displayed on a screen or through a serial output to which a computer can log data to a file.
The Dylos is battery powered which last for 6 hours and have a memory storage which store data for approximately whole week.

The Grimm 1.108 is a portable aerosol spectrometer (PAS) which is more expensive than the Dylos.
The Grimm measures the particle concentration over a size range of 0.3 um to 20 um in 15 bins.
The Grimm have various sampling frequencies and in this investigation the sample frequency is set to every 6 seconds 
which gives particle concentration in particles per \SI{100}{\ml}.
